        text: "<p>We use ceylon black tea, jasmine green tea, roasted oolong, and a special oolong varietal called Four Seasons as the base for other drinks and also as standalone beverages to savor and appreciate. Each of these teas is steeped (pun intended) in centuries of horticultural history. Like fine wine, they’re selected for carefully-defined attributes of flavor and fragrance. We pair different teas with different ingredients, bringing a deep understanding of how the unique qualities of each style of tea will complement the other flavors and textures.We take great pride in our ingredients, whether it be cooking them in-house, or procuring them from exceptional purveyors in Asia and California. Our locally-sourced products include barista-grade, non-dairy milks from Los Angeles-based Califia Farms and the probiotic drink Yakult, made in Fountain Valley.</p>",
