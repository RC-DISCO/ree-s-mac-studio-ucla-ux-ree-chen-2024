                    JQuery and React are both JavaScript libraries, but they
                    serve different purposes and have distinct approaches to
                    building web applications. Here's a comparison:

                    <li>
                        <b>Focus:</b> JQuery focuses on simplifying DOM
                        manipulation and event handling, while React focuses on
                        building efficient, dynamic user interfaces through a
                        component-based architecture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Architecture:</b> JQuery is a library that offers a
                        set of tools for common tasks, whereas React provides a
                        structured framework for building web applications using
                        a component-based approach.

                        <b>Performance:</b> For dynamic applications with high
                        user interaction and data updates, React's virtual DOM
                        offers better performance by reducing the need to
                        directly manipulate the DOM.

                        the client-side of web development, which is what users
                        interact with directly. Their work involves everything
                        that a user sees, clicks, or uses on a website or web

                    "Q5: In React, what are the different ways we can link to resources (e.g. Root Relative vs Document Relative)?"
                }
            >
                <p>
                    In React, linking to resources such as images, CSS files, or
                    other assets requires understanding the project structure
                    and how React and its build tools (like Webpack) manage
                    paths. Here's how you can handle root-relative and
                    document-relative links in a React project:
                </p>

                <p>Root-Relative Paths:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Description: </b>Root-relative paths start with a
                        slash (/) and define the path to a resource from the
                        root of your project. In a React application created
                        with Create React App (CRA), the root is often the
                        public directory.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Context: </b>When you build your React app, assets in
                        the public folder are copied into the build folder,
                        maintaining their paths relative to the root. Using
                        root-relative paths makes it straightforward to refer to
                        these assets. However, be cautious with root-relative
                        paths when deploying to a subdirectory on a server, as
                        the root might not correspond to the expected location.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Document-Relative Paths</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Description: </b>Document-relative paths are defined
                        in relation to the location of the current file. In
                        React, this usually pertains to importing assets in
                        JavaScript files or components.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Context: </b>This method leverages Webpack (or
                        another bundler that’s part of your React toolchain) to
                        resolve the path at build time. The asset is included in
                        the build output, and its path is correctly resolved
                        regardless of where the application is deployed. This
                        approach benefits from Webpack's features like asset
                        optimization and versioning.

                <p>
                    Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, emphasize flexible,
                    iterative development and collaboration among
                    cross-functional teams to deliver products. Each role within
                    an Agile team has specific responsibilities that contribute
                    to the project's success. Here are definitions for each
                    role.
                </p>
                <p>Product Manager:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Oversees the development and success of a product from a
                        high-level perspective. They focus on the product's
                        strategy, roadmap, and feature definition, often
                        liaising between the stakeholders and the development
                        team to ensure the product meets business goals and user
                        needs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Product Owner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Acts as the liaison between the development team and the
                        stakeholders. In Scrum, the Product Owner is responsible
                        for managing the product backlog, prioritizing features,
                        and ensuring that the team understands the items in the
                        product backlog to the level needed. They represent the
                        end users' and customers' interests.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Business Analyst:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Works to identify business needs and translate them into
                        technical requirements. The Business Analyst helps to
                        clarify the business logic of the project for the
                        development team, ensuring that the solutions being
                        developed meet the project objectives and solve the
                        right problems.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Scrum Master:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensures that the team follows Agile practices and
                        principles, particularly those specific to Scrum. The
                        Scrum Master facilitates Scrum ceremonies, removes
                        impediments, and works to ensure that the team is
                        productive and that the work environment is conducive to
                        achieving the sprint goals.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>UX (User Experience) Designer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        experience of the product for end-users. The UX Designer
                        conducts research to understand user needs and designs
                        the overall functionality of the product, often creating
                        wireframes, prototypes, and user flows to guide
                        development.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Developer/Engineer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Writes and maintains the source code of the application.
                        Developers are involved in the technical design,
                        implementation, testing, and debugging of the product.
                        They work closely with other team members to ensure that
                        features are developed according to requirements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    QA (Quality Assurance)/SDET (Software Development Engineer
                    in Test):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensures the product meets quality standards by designing
                        and implementing tests, reporting and managing defects,
                        and verifying fixes. SDETs, in particular, combine
                        software development skills with QA expertise to
                        automate testing and create tools to improve test
                        processes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>DevOps:</p>
                <ul>

                        Focuses on the practices, tools, and culture that enable
                        the rapid, reliable deployment and operation of
                        software. DevOps roles work to bridge the gap between
                        development and operations, aiming for continuous
                        integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) of code to
                        production environments. They manage infrastructure,
                        automate workflows, and monitor performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each role contributes to the Agile process, ensuring that
                    the team efficiently and effectively delivers high-quality
                    products that meet user needs and business goals.
